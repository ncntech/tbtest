## 🧩 Architecture

> This section describes the architectural structure of the application and its internal dependency model.
> The design follows principles inspired by Clean Architecture, with emphasis on separation of concerns, modularity, and long-term maintainability.


### Folder Structure

The project is organized using a feature-based structure with explicit separation between domain, data, and presentation layers.
The following diagram illustrates the base structure of the project:

```mermaid
flowchart TB

subgraph Presentation[" "]
  direction TB
  page
  bloc
  widget
  shared
end

subgraph Feature[" "]
  direction TB

  data --> model_m[model]
  data --> repo_m[repo]
  data --> source_m[source]

  domain --> entity_d[entity]
  domain --> repo_d[repo]
  domain --> source_d[source]
  domain --> use_case_d[use_case]
end

lib --> core
core --> feature
feature --> Feature

lib --> presentation
presentation --> Presentation
```

> The `presentation/` folder is kept outside of the `core/` directory to enforce strict separation between application logic and UI components.
> Below is what each layer is responsible for using the **Profile** feature as an example for typical files ⬇️


### Domain Layer

| Folder      | Responsibility | Typical Files |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| `entity/`   | Business models | `profile.dart`<br>`profile_failure.dart` |
| `use_case/` | Business operations | `get_profile_use_case.dart` |
| `repo/`     | Repository contracts | `profile_repo.dart` |
| `source/`   | Data source contracts | `profile_local_source.dart`<br>`profile_remote_source.dart` |

> The domain layer contains pure business logic and application rules for implementing feature behavior in the application.
> It defines core use cases and entities and remains independent of external frameworks and data sources.


### Data Layer

| Folder     | Responsibility | Typical Files |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| `model/`   | Data transfer objects (DTOs) | `profile_dto.dart`<br>`profile_response_dto.dart` |
| `repo/`    | Repository implementations | `profile_repo_impl.dart` |
| `source/`  | Local / Remote data source implementations | `profile_local_source_impl.dart`<br>`profile_remote_source_impl.dart` |

> The data layer is used for retrieving, storing, and transforming external data for application features.
> It implements domain contracts and performs DTO-to-entity mapping.


### Presentation Layer

- `pages/` contains all application screens
- `bloc/` contains Cubits and Blocs for state management
- `widget/` contains reusable UI components
- `shared/` contains routing, theming, constants, utilities, etc...

> The presentation layer is separated from core feature modules as a deliberate design choice.
> This structure reflects a personal preference for improved screen discoverability and centralized UI infrastructure.


### Dependency Injection

The application uses annotation-based dependency injection with `injectable` and `get_it` to connect layers and enable controlled execution flows.
Dependencies are registered automatically through code generation.

Example objects injection:
``` dart
@LazySingleton()
class ProfileCubit extends Cubit<ProfileState> {
  final GetProfileUseCase _getProfileUseCase;

  ProfileCubit(this._getProfileUseCase) : super(ProfileState.initial());
}

@LazySingleton()
class GetProfileUseCase {
  final ProfileRepo _profileRepo;

  const GetProfileUseCase(this._profileRepo);
}
```

Example resolution hierarchy:

```text
ProfilePage
  → ProfileCubit
    → GetProfileUseCase
      → ProfileRepository
        → ProfileRemoteSource / ProfileLocalSource
          → API
```
